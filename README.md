## my Journey🥳

"I'm a fun-loving coder who enjoys learning new things. Coding is a fun and cool thing to do. I started with **Python language**, it was easy to learn 🤭. **OOP** concepts were a bit confusing, but after learning Python, I started learning JavaScript 💓. I learned JS and Python comparatively, it was really fun 😇. Sometimes I forget certain things, but I look them up and use them when needed. Our brain can't remember everything, it's designed to remember specific things, I think 🙄😊. It's normal for our brain to forget things, so I think it's okay. Later, I started learning C++, but I didn't know why I was learning it 🤭😁. Then I learned **Go**, but it didn't click with me, I liked its code style though. Overall, what I've learned has helped me do a lot of things, but there's still a lot I can't do. "I Love Code💖"
